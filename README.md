## _Tour Planner_

## Implementation
Used React.js to implement this application. Also, I have used some libraries from materialUI(https://mui.com/) for some components and styling. 

## How to use
At the start user have to login with a valid username and password. On a successful login, a user token is stored in the session storage and user is redirected to the `Home` page.
The `Home` page shows two tabs, one for `Trips` and the other one for `Vehicles`. Both tabs contains tables for the corresponding component. Click the expand button to view details about any record in the table.

## How to run
You can clone or download the project in your local repository 
```sh
https://github.com/farhin105/tour_planner_app.git
```
Execute the following commands to run the application
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
